### Hi there 👋

I'm Shailendra Ahir. I work as a software engineer during the day. At night, I sleep ;) Just kidding - I work on my side project to help my friend at his business.


- 🔭 I’m currently working at Mphasis Limited 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning New backend of backstage.io
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- 😄 Pronouns: I don't really believe in it but I respect those who believe in it.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can sing as well but not very good at it
