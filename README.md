### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

I'm Shailendra Ahir. I work as a software engineer during the day. At night, I sleep ;) Just kidding - I work on my side project to help my friend at his business.


- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at Mphasis Limited 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning New backend of backstage.io
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects.
- ğŸ˜„ Pronouns: I don't really believe in it but I respect those who believe in it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can sing as well but not very good at it
