### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shailendra Ahir. I work as a software engineer during the day. At night, I sleep ;) Just kidding - I work on my side project to keep my skills up to date.


- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at JPMC
- ðŸŒ± Currently practicing UI Technologies
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: I don't really believe in it but I respect those who believe in it.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I can sing as well but not very good at it
